React
  props, state, and component communication
  the ES5 Shim library you need to support IE8

  render React on the server.
  React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance.

  1. You DO NOT GET any of the following:
    An event system (other than vanilla DOM events)
    Any AJAX capabilities whatsoever
    Any form of a data layer
    Promises
    Any application framework at all
    Any idea how implement the above

  React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display.

  Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.

  JSX is optional and not required to use React.
    This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX.




    JSX & props
       - taking input data
          (accessed via this.props)
      var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
        render: function() {
          return <div>Hello <em>{this.props.name} the {this.props.job}</em></div>;
        }
      });

      React.render(<HelloMessage name="John" job="Carpenter" />, mountNode);
